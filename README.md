**Implementing the first participatory AI architecture with power awareness and ecosystemic intelligence.**

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **PVF-AB (Primitive Valence Foundation - Affective Between)**, an ecosystemic affective intelligence architecture that overcomes the structural limitations of individualist AI for participatory meaning-making.

Based on the theoretical paper **"Beyond the Asymptote: Ecosystemic Affective Intelligence and the Structural Limits of Individualist AI"** (70 pages, 25 equations, 4 theorems).

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Porous Markov Blankets**
Allowing mutual influence beyond rigid agent boundaries: $I(\psi_A; \psi_B) > \epsilon$

### 2. **Dynamic Narrative Dimensionality**
$K(t)$ expands when cultural concepts exceed fixed capacity

### 3. **Power-Aware Precision Weighting**
With resistance preservation for marginalized voices

### 4. **Collective Free Energy Minimization**
Replacing individual optimization: $\min \mathcal{F}_C$ not $\min E_T$

## Architecture Comparison

| Component | PVF (Individualist) | PVF-AB (Ecosystemic) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Boundaries | Rigid Markov blankets | Porous Markov blankets |
| Narrative Space | Fixed $K=8$ | Dynamic $K(t)$ |
| Optimization | Individual $E_T$ minimization | Collective $\mathcal{F}_C$ minimization |
| Power Awareness | Neutral (PEI=0.5) | Adaptive (PEI>0.7 target) |
| Social Coupling | Zero ($\mathbf{W}_v^{AB}=0$) | Adaptive weights $w_{ab}(t)$ |

## Four Operational Indicators

PVF-AB is designed to achieve:
1. **Epistemic Convergence** ($\text{Ec} > 0.30$): Collective prediction error reduction
2. **Narrative Coherence** ($\text{NC} > 0.80$): Shared meaning alignment over time  
3. **Power Equity Index** ($\text{PEI} > 0.70$): Prevention of semiotic domination
4. **Creative Tension** ($\text{CT} > 0.30$): Productive disagreement maintenance

## Getting Started

*Implementation begins upon grant funding. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed timeline.*

## Grant Application

This project is part of an **Awesome Foundation grant application** to fund implementation hardware (laptop for development). The theory is complete—now we need to convert 25 equations into working code.

**Budget:** $1,000 for refurbished laptop + interface prototyping phone

**Timeline:** 8 weeks to working prototype

**Commitment:** All code MIT-licensed, open-source from day one
